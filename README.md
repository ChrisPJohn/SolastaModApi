# SolastaModApi

## Getting Started

After creating a new respository based on this template you should:
1) Generate a GUID for your mod and set that in Main.ModGuidNamespace
2) Update Info.json with mod info (ID, DisplayName, Author in particular).
3) Rename the build output dll and update the Info.json with this information. Each mod needs a uniquely named dll.
